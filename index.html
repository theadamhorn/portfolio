                    As you can see from the picture to the left, I am a recreational hockey player. I became interested
                    in ice hockey during the early-1990s for two main reasons, although I never played in any
                    recreational leagues until I moved to Sacramento. The two reasons I picked up my love for hockey are
                    the establishment of the San Jose Sharks and the influence of my Big Brother. See, I was raised in
                    San Jose and the whole city was swept into a frenzy. That was the same time my mom enrolled me in
                    the Big Brothers Big Sisters program since she was a single parent and thought it would be good for
                    me to have a male role model. My Big Brother was from upstate New York, was a hockey fan, and grew
                    up playing hockey on frozen ponds. As a seven-year-old, I could not help to be captivated!!
                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward and I now live in Sacramento. After earning my Bachelors in Political Science and
                    Communication from Fresno State, I jumped into the political campaign world. It was a good fit at
                    the time because retail politics is what initially drew me to the field in the first place. That,
                    and during the cusp of the Financial Crisis other options seemed rather limited. The first paid
                    campaign I worked on was for Barack Obama in Las Vegas. Getting our nation’s first African American
                    President elected to office is a proud moment in my life. That campaign opened up a series of
                    campaign management opportunities that led me to Queens, NY, and eventually to the capital of
                    California, where I transitioned to the chapter of my career with the State Legislature.
                    <br><br>
                    I currently work for a Sacramento-based lobbying firm representing an array of clients. However, my
                    life is not all work and politics. I am a recent MBA graduate from Santa Clara University Leavey
                    School of Business, and taking a coding boot camp through University of California, Davis. In my
                    free time, I enjoy getting outdoors to backpack with my dog Vesta, traveling (which during COVID-19
                    means road trips), reading, and playing ice hockey!
